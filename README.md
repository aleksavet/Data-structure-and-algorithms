**Assignment One**: Search in Dynamic Sets
In this project, we explored various data structures to evaluate their performance in dynamic sets. Specifically, we implemented and compared four different data structures: Splay Tree, Red-Black Tree, Hash Tables (with collision resolution using quadratic probing and chaining). The focus was on analyzing the effectiveness of these structures with respect to insertion, deletion, and search operations under various conditions.

**Assignment Two**: Binary Decision Diagrams (BDD)
This project involved the creation of a program for constructing and manipulating Binary Decision Diagrams (BDDs). BDDs are used for efficient representation and manipulation of Boolean functions. The implemented program allows users to create and work with BDDs, emphasizing their utility in representing Boolean expressions compactly and efficiently.
